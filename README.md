This example demonstrates a common error in Swift when calling functions with parameters.  The function `calculateArea` requires labels for its parameters.  The first call shows the correct usage, including the labels 'width:' and 'height:'. The second call omits the label for the 'height' parameter, resulting in a compiler error. This is because Swift uses named parameters which enhance code readability and prevent ambiguity. This README explains how to resolve such errors by providing the required argument labels.
